<p>An armed and fully operational b... template!</p>

<!--Also we're going to need a template html for our directive. 
We could do it inline, but let's make another file instead. 
Just name it something that makes sense for the name of your 
directive and put it in the same directory as your directive 
file.-->

<!--For your template just make a <div> and inside a <h1> tag 
that says "User". Now in your home route html add in your directive. 
It will look like this if you named it dirDisplay: 
<dir-display></dir-display>-->
<div>
	<h1>User</h1>
</div>

<!--Start up your app and go to the home route. Check and make 
sure you see User where your directive was placed.-->

<!--If you're not seeing it at this point it could mean a few things. 
Here's some more common issues.
You didn't link your directive in your index as a script.
Your name for your directive doesn't match the name in your html. 
Remember camel case becomes snake case so myDirective becomes 
<my-directive></my-directive>.
You're file path to your html template is wrong. You have to think 
of file paths in angular as relative to the index.-->
